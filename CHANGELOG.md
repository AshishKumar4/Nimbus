# Changelog

All notable Nimbus releases are summarized here. Package-level versions are
published independently in the `@nimbus-sh` npm scope.

## Unreleased

- Fixed compiler privilege escalation: `EsbuildService` now accepts a
  `CredentialedVfs` instead of a raw `SqliteVFS`. Embedders compiling authored
  code must pass the author's view (`new EsbuildService(vfs.as(authorCred))`);
  kernel callers explicitly pass `vfs.as(CRED_KERNEL)`. Transform-only use
  still needs no VFS. Absolute and transitive imports cannot read beyond the
  supplied view's authority.
- Fixed failed VFS metadata writes publishing uncommitted times, modes or
  ownership in memory. Added `SqliteVFS.withTransaction(callback)` for embedders
  committing their SQL rows together with filesystem writes: rollback restores
  the inode/content mirror, and revisions/watch events publish only on commit.

## 2026-08-11

The first publish since 2026-06-06. Everything on npm until now was built from
that day's tree, so the jump is large — this entry covers only what changes for
someone consuming the packages, not the several hundred commits behind it.

### Background Processes (breaking)

- `startProcess` now returns as soon as the command has a pid, instead of
  waiting for it to finish. Until now it awaited the command to completion and
  then guessed which pid it had started by diffing the process table, so
  `sleep 5` took five seconds and dev servers, watchers, and anything else
  long-running were impossible.
- `NimbusStartResult` changed shape to match: it is now
  `{ command, pid, process, ports, startedAt }`. The exec fields it used to
  carry — `exitCode`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `success`, `duration`, `timestamp` —
  are gone, because they described a finished command and cannot describe one
  that has just started. `pid` and `process` are no longer nullable.
- Read the output and the exit through `processes.logs(pid)`, which returns a
  cursor, the chunks since that cursor, and the exit record once it lands. Or
  use `processes.attach(pid)`, which is async-iterable and can also write to
  stdin, resize, signal, and kill.
- **If you read `exitCode` or `stdout` off a `startProcess` result, that code
  needs updating.** This is the reason both packages move to `0.2.0` rather
  than a patch: a `^0.1.x` range will not pick the new versions up, which is
  deliberate.

### Files

- Added `files.lstat`, `files.rename`, `files.chmod`, and `files.readRange`.
  `readRange` reads a window of a file without materializing the whole thing.
- `processes.logs` is now typed as `NimbusProcessLogsResult` instead of
  `unknown`.

### Port Previews

- Added preview host URLs — `<port>--<session>.<suffix>` — alongside the
  existing path-style previews. Set `NIMBUS_PREVIEW_HOST_SUFFIX` on the
  deployment; `Nimbus.fromEnv` reads it off the bindings, and remote clients
  pass `previewHostSuffix` in config. A preview host reaches the port forward
  and nothing else.
- Added `isPreviewHostRequest` and the `@nimbus-sh/worker/preview-host`
  subpath.

### Session Agent

- Added the session agent and its Cloudflare OAuth surface, with the
  credentials held in encrypted cookies. `@nimbus-sh/config` takes an optional
  `agent` block; the secrets stay out of it and belong in
  `wrangler secret put`.

### Fixes

- Fixed remote `files.write` throwing after the write had already landed. The
  client validated the result against `z.undefined()` while the Durable Object
  answers with the byte count it wrote. This one never reached npm — it was
  introduced and fixed between releases — but it is here because anyone
  tracking `main` in that window hit it.
- `nimbus session new` authenticates with a bearer token.

### Packages

- Published:
  - `@nimbus-sh/worker@0.2.0`
  - `@nimbus-sh/sdk@0.2.0`
  - `@nimbus-sh/cli@0.1.8`
  - `@nimbus-sh/react@0.1.4`
  - `@nimbus-sh/config@0.1.4`
- Unchanged, not republished: `create-nimbus-app@0.1.6`.
- `@nimbus-sh/react@0.1.4` is a range fix and nothing else — every shipped
  file is byte-identical to `0.1.3`. Its peer on the SDK was `^0.1.4`, which
  npm cannot satisfy with `0.2.0`, so installing the new SDK beside the React
  component failed to resolve. It now accepts `^0.1.4 || ^0.2.0`. The
  component imports nothing from the SDK — it is an iframe wrapper — so the
  breaking type change does not reach it.
- `@nimbus-sh/sdk` needs `@nimbus-sh/worker` at the matching major-equivalent
  range: it imports `@nimbus-sh/worker/preview-host` at runtime, and that
  subpath does not exist before `0.2.0`.
