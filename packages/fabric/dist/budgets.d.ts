/**
 * budgets.ts — per-DO accounting for the platform budgets the fabric spends:
 * the Durable Object's Dynamic Worker concurrency limit, the facet-ID
 * lifetime budget, and the dynamic-worker module-map ceiling.
 *
 * The Dynamic Worker model is Cloudflare's documented one
 * ({@link DO_DYNAMIC_WORKER_LIMIT}): a Durable Object may have a fixed number
 * of DISTINCT Dynamic Workers with in-flight requests at once, shared across
 * every concurrent request to that object (one I/O context), and any number
 * of in-flight requests to the same Dynamic Worker count as one. Only
 * in-flight requests count: a loader id with nothing in flight holds nothing.
 *
 * The ledger counts, per hosting actor, the distinct workers that are in
 * flight right now, keyed by loader id (a fresh key per unkeyed `load`), plus
 * the width fan-outs have claimed and not yet released. A fan-out spends only
 * the {@link dynamicWorkerHeadroom} that leaves, so work a Durable Object
 * already has in flight — a resident process, the esbuild facet, a git
 * network op, another fan-out — keeps its slots.
 *
 * Keyed weakly off the hosting actor's `ctx`, like the facet slot books: the
 * limit is per Durable Object, and dynamic workers die with the isolate that
 * loaded them, so a ledger that goes away with its host describes nothing
 * that still exists.
