/**
 * loader-ledger.ts — per-DO accounting for the Worker Loader's two caps.
 *
 * Measured on production workerd: a Durable Object admits ~5–6 concurrent
 * dynamic workers before the platform refuses with "Too many concurrent
 * dynamic workers", one DO method can drive at most 4 concurrent Loader
 * fetches, and loader-cache entries are never released — every DISTINCT
 * `loader.get(id)` permanently consumes one of the dynamic-worker slots for
 * the object's lifetime. Nimbus stays under the caps by construction
 * (`IN_DO_THRESHOLD` = 5 in the fanout pool), which until now meant the slots
 * were counted in prose. This ledger counts them at the fabric's loader call
 * sites instead — the loader pool's slots, a resident process's keyed worker,
 * a one-shot's load — so proximity is measurable and a cap failure can name
 * the ids actually holding slots.
 *
 * Measurement only: no admission control. The caps are the platform's, they
 * are approximate ("~5–6"), and a gate on an approximate number would refuse
 * work the platform would have run.
 *
 * Keyed weakly off the hosting actor's `ctx`, like the facet slot books: the
 * caps are per Durable Object, and dynamic workers die with the isolate that
 * loaded them, so a ledger that goes away with its host describes nothing
 * that still exists.

 * (`trackLoaderFetch(ctx, () => entrypoint.execute(...))`) left the hosting
