/**
 * process-host.ts — the two substrates a resident process can run on, and the
 * one value that picks between them.
 *
 * `process-fabric.ts` owns what a resident process IS. This module
 * owns only where it lives, behind `ProcessHost`:
 *
 *   facet — the process is a named child actor of the user's own session DO.
 *   peer  — the process is a named child actor of a SIBLING session DO, and
 *           the coordinator reaches it over one held-open RPC, which
 *           `PeerProcessHost` here calls and `PeerHost` (peer-host.ts)
 *           serves.
 *
 * Both call the same `processes(ctx, env).spawn`. The peer leg is not a second process
 * implementation; it is the same call made on a different actor, which is why
 * the runner, the boot spec, the class name, the writer handshake, the start
 * contract and the lifecycle are shared code rather than parallel paths.
 *
 * Choosing between them
 * ─────────────────────
 * One value for the whole deployment, resolved by the embedder's config seam
 * (Nimbus reads `NIMBUS_PROCESS_HOST` in the worker's own selector) and
 * handed to `createProcessHost`. No spawn site chooses; no program name, mode
 * or payload size reaches the choice. If a decision about a particular
 * process ever appears here, the heavy/light classifier has grown back and
 * should be deleted again.
 *
 *   |          | spawn      | memory      | CPU        | SQLite |
 *   |----------|------------|-------------|------------|--------|
 *   | facet    | 8-16 ms    | independent | SHARED     | own    |
 *   | peer     | 242-359 ms | independent | independent| own    |
 *
 * Facet CPU is shared because facets are separate isolates inside ONE actor
 * thread: awaiting I/O yields it completely (measured 0 ms of sibling impact),
 * but a non-yielding loop stalls every sibling for its full duration
 * (measured 6,852 ms). A peer pays ~20x the spawn cost to buy that back.
 *
 * What the peer leg has to do differently, and why none of it reaches the
 * process
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   payloads — a whole structured-clone RPC value is capped at 32 MiB, and
 *              pi's node snapshot alone serializes to 44,252,709 bytes. Boot
 *              specs name their large members BY PATH, so what crosses is a
 *              path and the host reads the bytes off the coordinator's disk in
 *              4 MiB ranges through the supervisor. Nothing large is ever an
 *              RPC argument, so nothing has to be streamed or replayed.
 *   requests — workerd refuses to transfer an object owned by a
 *              dynamically-loaded worker across a sibling-DO hop, so a request
 *              travels to the peer as PARTS and the response comes back as
 *              parts, both with plain `ReadableStream` bodies that RPC carries
 *              with flow control. A live SSE body still streams; nothing is
 *              buffered.
 *   liveness — the host leg is held open for the process's whole life, which
 *              is also what keeps the hosting DO resident. A peer therefore
 *              never outlives its coordinator: the coordinator dying cancels
 *              the inbound call and the facet dies with it. Nothing in this
 *              fabric arms an alarm, on either substrate.
 *
 * WebSockets are the one thing on that list the RPC path cannot carry at all.
 * A 101 Response owns a live socket, and RPC's Request/Response transport
 * reconstructs a value rather than handing the socket over, so an upgrade
 * stays on FETCH semantics for every hop: a facet is fetched directly, and a
 * peer is fetched as a service binding which then fetches its hosted facet.
 * Two headers carry what the RPC arguments would have — see
 * {@link HOSTED_WEBSOCKET_KEY_HEADER} — and a per-process capability makes
 * that pair unforgeable by anything that did not open the process.
